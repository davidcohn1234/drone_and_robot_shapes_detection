# Drone and robot shapes detection
This project uses tello drone and robomaster ep for detecting 8 two-dimensional shapes.  
The 8 shapes are:  
circle, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, square, rhombus, star, triangle.  
I used `python 3.8.10`  
### Example output for robot:

### Example output for tello drone:

## Instructions
For running the code to the following:
1. Open any folder you want to clone the project into (in my case I opened the folder `~/my_developments`).
1. right click on an empty area of the folder and click on `Open in Terminal`.
1. In the terminal, write the command `git clone git@github.com:davidcohn1234/drone_and_robot_shapes_detection.git` and wait for the command to finish clonning.
1. Open `Pycharm` then click on `File->Open` and choose the folder `drone_and_robot_shapes_detection` that you just clonned.
1. Click on `File->Settings...`
1. Open pycharm (you can work on any editor you prefer but the instructions here will be for pycharm since this is the only editor I used).
1. Go the terminal (in pycharm) and write the command `pip install -r requirements`
