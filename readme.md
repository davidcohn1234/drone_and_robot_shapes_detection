# Drone and robot shapes detection
This project uses tello drone and robomaster ep for detecting 8 two-dimensional shapes.  
The 8 shapes are:  
circle, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, square, rhombus, star, triangle.  
I used `python 3.8.10`  
### Example output for robot:  
<img src="./resources_for_readme/gif_videos/robot/robomaster_ep_pov.gif" width="480" height="360" />

### Example output for tello drone:

## Instructions
For running the code to the following:
1. open `git bash` in any folder you want to clone the project.
2. Write the command `git clone git@github.com:davidcohn1234/drone_and_robot_shapes_detection.git`
3. Make sure you work on a new virtual environment.
4. Open pycharm (you can work on any editor you prefer but the instructions here will be for pycharm since this is the only editor I used).
5. Go the terminal (in pycharm) and write the command `pip install -r requirements`
