# Drone and robot shapes detection
This project uses tello drone and robomaster ep for detecting 8 two-dimensional shapes.  
The 8 shapes are:  
circle, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, square, rhombus, star, triangle
I used python 3.8.10

## Instructions
For running the code to the following:
1. open `git bash` in any folder you want to clone the project.
2. Write the command `git clone git@github.com:davidcohn1234/drone_and_robot_shapes_detection.git`
3. Make sure you work on a new virtual environment.
4. Open pycharm (you can work on any editor you prefer but the instructions here will be for pycharm since this is the only editor I used).
5. Go the terminal (in pycharm) and write the command `pip install -r requirements`
